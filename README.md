About the project
The project is a basic beginner level portfolio web page.
each buttons are linked to a document.
there is a separate register.html file that is linked to contact button in the index.html file. which is a form page to gather information.
since this is a basic project it is not responsive, so it suits best on PC.

         I used github as a host for the sites so I will provide the link to show what the site looks.
