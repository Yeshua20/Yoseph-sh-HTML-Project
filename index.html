    <!-- What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. 
For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

    Versions Of HTML ?

HTML has never been like this, what it is right now. HTML, like many other languages has evolved with the passage of time and today it's much better and versatile than it was a long time ago.
Different Version of HTML has different properties. But today we use HTML5, HTML5 is the latest version of HTML.

    HTML 1.0
HTML 1.0 or first version of HTML was a version of SGML that had ability to link different document or pages using 'href'.

HTML 1.0 had 20 elements or tags, now latest version of HTML, ie HTML5 has a lot more.

    HTML 2.0
After HTML 1.0, the second version of HTML was released in 1994. HTML 2.0 was an expansion of HTML 1.0.

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was behind it's creation.

    HTML 3.2
HTML 3.2 was released In 1997. HTML 3.2 had many new features like tables, superscript, subscript etc.

Two most important features introduced in HTML 3.2 were tables and text flow around images.
Tables were widely used and programmers still use them but it is not recommended anymore. In HTML5 div tags and other semantic elements are used more frequently instead of table element.


    HTML 4.01

HTML 4.01 was released In 1999. HTML 4.01 introduced features like scripting, style sheets, better tables, better forms frames and embedding objects.

HTML 4.01 was a revised version of HTML 4.0, it also included features for the disabled people to enhance their interactivity with the Global world through Internet.


    HTML5
So all of this added up and then after so many year HTML5 was released in 2014. HTML5 is the best version of HTML up till now. HTML5 improved user interactivity so much and also lessened the burden of devices.

HTML5 fully supports all kind of media application that are there. HTML5 supports both audio and video media content. HTML5 also provides full support for JavaScript to run in the background.




     What is XHTML?

XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language. XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML. XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application. 
XHTML is supported by all major browsers.

    Versions of XHTML

        XHTML 1.0
It is the first version that was introduced in 2000.

        XHTML 1.1
An updated version which was released in 2001.

        XHTML 2.0
It was a revision to XHTML, which was eventually abandoned in favour of XHTML 5

        XHTML 5
An XMl based syntax for HTML5. however, its not widely used due to its complexity, strictness, and
lack of browser support.
