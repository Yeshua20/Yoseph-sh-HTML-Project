HTML 1.0 or first version of HTML was a version of SGML that had ability to link different document or pages using 'href'.

HTML 1.0 had 20 elements or tags, now latest version of HTML, ie HTML5 has a lot more.

    HTML 2.0
After HTML 1.0, the second version of HTML was released in 1994. HTML 2.0 was an expansion of HTML 1.0.

    HTML 3.2
HTML 3.2 was released In 1997. HTML 3.2 had many new features like tables, superscript, subscript etc.

Two most important features introduced in HTML 3.2 were tables and text flow around images.
Tables were widely used and programmers still use them but it is not recommended anymore. In HTML5 div tags and other semantic elements are used more frequently instead of table element.
